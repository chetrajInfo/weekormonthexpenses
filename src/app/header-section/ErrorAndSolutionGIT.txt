ERROR-1:
-------------------------------------------------------
fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

This error message typically occurs when you're trying to push changes to or pull changes
 from a remote repository that Git can't find or access. This can be caused by a few different issues:

Remote URL is Incorrect: The URL for the remote repository (known as 'origin' by default) might be incorrect.
You can check the URL of your remote with the following command:

git remote -v
If the URL is incorrect or it doesn't show any remote, you can add the correct one using:

git remote add origin <your_remote_repository_URL>
Replace <your_remote_repository_URL> with the URL of your remote repository, 
which should look something like https://github.com/username/repo.git or git@github.com:username/repo.git.

Access Rights: The error message suggests there could be an issue with access rights. Make sure you have 
permission to access the remote repository. If you're using SSH to connect to the repository, make sure your 
public key is added to your GitHub account. If you're using HTTPS, you might need to enter your username and password.

Network Issues: There might be a network issue that's preventing you from connecting to the remote repository. 
Check your internet connection, and if you're behind a firewall or proxy, make sure your Git client is configured to work with it.

Repository Doesn't Exist: The remote repository might not exist. If the repository was deleted, or if the URL was 
entered incorrectly when the remote was added, this error could occur. Check that the repository exists by visiting 
the URL in your web browser.

If none of the above solutions work, it might be a good idea to clone the repository again in a new directory (if possible),
make your changes there, and then try pushing again. This will ensure that your local repository is correctly linked to the remote.

how to delete the repository in github

Deleting a repository on GitHub is a straightforward process, but it's also irreversible: once a repository is deleted,
it cannot be recovered. Make sure you have a backup of any important data before deleting a repository. Here's how you 
can delete a repository on GitHub:

Navigate to the Main Page of the Repository: Login to your GitHub account and open the repository you wish to delete.

Go to the Repository Settings: Click on the "Settings" tab. This is usually located at the far right of the tab list 
at the top of the repository page.

Scroll Down to the "Danger Zone": At the bottom of the settings page, you'll find a section called "Danger Zone".

Click on "Delete This Repository": In the Danger Zone, there's a button that says "Delete this repository".

Confirm the Deletion: GitHub will ask you to confirm the deletion by typing in the name of the repository. 
Type in the name and click on "I understand the consequences, delete this repository".

And that's it. Your repository will be deleted. Please remember to be careful when deleting repositories. 
Once a repository is deleted, it can't be restored. Make sure you really want to delete it before you confirm.

how to remove repository from locally

If you want to remove a local Git repository (i.e., a repository on your computer), you simply need to 
delete the repository's directory (folder).

Here's how you can do it:

Using the command line:

Open your command line tool (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on MacOS/Linux), navigate to the directory 
that contains your repository's folder, and use the rm (short for remove) command to delete it:

# Move to the directory containing the repository
cd path_to_your_directory

# Remove the entire repository directory
rm -rf repository_name
Replace path_to_your_directory with the path to the directory that contains your repository, and replace repository_name 
with the name of your repository's folder.

Using a file manager:

You can also delete a local repository by using your system's file manager (Windows Explorer on Windows, Finder on MacOS). 
Navigate to the repository's folder and delete it just like you would delete any other folder.

IMPORTANT: This operation is not reversible. Be absolutely sure that you want to delete the repository. You should also 
make sure that you've pushed any important changes to your remote repository on GitHub (or any other Git hosting service) 
before you delete your local repository.

git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/chetrajInfo/weekormonthexpenses.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/chetrajInfo/weekormonthexpenses.git (push)
when i do after removing repository it still show the origin https://github.com/chetrajInfo/weekormonthexpenses.git (fetch)


If you deleted your local repository by removing its directory but you're still seeing the remote origin when running 
git remote -v, it's likely that you're running the command from within another Git repository directory.

In Git, remotes are specific to each repository. When you delete a repository by removing its directory, all information 
about its remotes is also removed.

Here's what you can do to check:

Run pwd in your terminal (or cd with no arguments on Windows Command Prompt). This command will print the path of the 
current directory. Make sure that this isn't the path of a Git repository.

Check if you are in a Git repository by running git status. If you see something like "fatal: not a git repository 
(or any of the parent directories): .git", it means you are not in a Git repository. If you see something else, you 
are in a Git repository.

If you're in a Git repository and you want to remove the 'origin' remote, you can do so with the following command:

git remote remove origin

After running this command, git remote -v should no longer list 'origin' as a remote.

Again, be careful when removing remotes or deleting repositories. Make sure you're in the correct repository and 
that you won't lose any important data by removing a remote.

Reinitialized existing Git repository in D:/WeeklyMonthlyExpenses/weekormonthexpense/.git/ while pushing angular project to github

It seems like you are trying to initialize a Git repository in a directory that already has one (as indicated by the message 
"Reinitialized existing Git repository"). To push your Angular project to GitHub, you would typically follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize a Git repository (if not already initialized)

git init

If you get the message "Reinitialized existing Git repository", it means the repository was already initialized, 
so you can move to the next step.

Step 2: Add the files to the repository

git add .
This command stages all the files in the directory for commit. The "." represents all files in the current directory 
and subdirectories.

Step 3: Commit the files

git commit -m "Initial commit"

This command creates a new commit with the changes you staged. Replace "Initial commit" with a message describing the 
changes you're committing.

Step 4: Add the remote repository

Before you can push your code to GitHub, you need to add the remote repository. You can do this with the git remote add command:


git remote add origin https://github.com/chetrajInfo/weekormonthexpenses.git
Replace the URL with the URL of your repository on GitHub. If a remote called 'origin' already exists and you want to 
replace it, you can use the git remote set-url command:


git remote set-url origin https://github.com/chetrajInfo/weekormonthexpenses.git
Step 5: Push your code to GitHub

Finally, you can push your code to GitHub with the git push command:

git push -u origin master

This command pushes your code to the 'master' branch of the 'origin' remote. If you're using the 'main' branch 
(as is now the default on GitHub), replace 'master' with 'main'. The -u flag sets the upstream branch, which makes
Git remember the parameters for future git push and git pull commands.
